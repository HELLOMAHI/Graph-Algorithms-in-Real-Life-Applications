## Assignment Overview

This project demonstrates the application of **graph algorithms** to solve real-world problems such as social networking, route optimization, emergency response, and infrastructure design.  
It is part of **Lab Assignment 3: Graph Algorithms in Real-Life Applications**.

Each problem is modeled as a graph and solved using fundamental algorithms like **BFS**, **Bellman-Ford**, **Dijkstra**, and **Prim’s MST**.
